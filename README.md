# PreviaPred
PreviaPred predicts postpartum hemorrhage in placenta previa patients. It uses T2-weighted MRI (nnU-Net for auto placental segmentation) and clinical data via TabPFN, outputting binary massive PPH (>1000 mL) prediction and continuous blood loss estimates (works with small datasets) to aid surgical planning and perioperative safety.
